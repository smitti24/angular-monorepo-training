## Notes for Claude

- Student has 10 years Angular experience - skip basic Angular concepts
- Focus heavily on NX architecture and Microfrontend patterns
- Use Signals throughout (not traditional RxJS where signals work better)
- Tailwind for all styling
- Student implements everything - Claude provides instructions only
- Be concise but thorough on architectural decisions
- Real-world patterns are important (Tech Lead needs to teach team)
