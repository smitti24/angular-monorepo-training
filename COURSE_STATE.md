## Key Concepts Covered

### Lesson 1.1
- Monorepo vs Polyrepo - single repo, multiple projects
- NX as a build system with monorepo tooling
- Dependency graph - NX understands code relationships
- Affected commands - only build/test what changed
- Key terminology: workspace, project, target, executor, generator

### Lesson 1.2
- NX workspace should live at the **root** of the git repo (industry standard)
- NX is plugin-based: core (`nx`) handles task runner/caching/graph, plugins (`@nx/angular`) add generators & executors
- `@nx/angular` plugin provides Angular-specific generators (app, lib, component) and executors (build, serve, test)
- App naming convention: "shell" = the MF host app that loads remotes
- Key generator flags: `--standalone` (no NgModules), `--routing`, `--ssr=false` (MFs don't mix with SSR)
- NX convention: apps in `apps/`, libraries in `libs/`
- **project.json** replaces angular.json — each project gets its own, defines targets (build, serve, test, lint)
- **Targets** = commands NX can run; **Executors** = the tools that run them (e.g., `@angular/build:application`)
- **Configurations** — production vs development per target, with `defaultConfiguration` controlling which is default
- **nx.json** stores workspace-wide settings: targetDefaults (caching, dependency order), plugins, generator defaults
- **Generator defaults** saved in nx.json → next `nx generate` reuses choices (Playwright, Vitest, CSS)
- `tags: []` in project.json — used later for enforcing library boundaries (Module 3)
- Standalone Angular: `bootstrapApplication()` + `ApplicationConfig` — no NgModules
- **esbuild** chosen for fast dev builds; will switch to **webpack** when adding Module Federation (Module 7)
- `"dependsOn": ["^build"]` means NX builds dependencies before the app (topological ordering)
- `"cache": true` on targets enables NX computation caching

### Lesson 1.3
- CLI pattern: `nx <command> [project] [options]`
- Three command categories: task runners, code generation, workspace info
- `nx run project:target:config` = explicit form; `nx target project` = shorthand
- `run-many -t <target>` runs across all projects — essential for CI
- `nx graph` visualizes project dependency graph in browser
- `--dry-run` on generators previews without writing files
- NX caching: hashes inputs, replays output if nothing changed (instant second runs)
- `nx reset` clears cache; `nx report` shows plugin versions for debugging
- **Version management**: always use `nx migrate` to upgrade — never manually bump @nx/* versions
- `migrations.json` may be created during migration — run `nx migrate --run-migrations` then delete it

### Lesson 1.4
- Config inheritance: nx.json (workspace) → project.json (project) → `nx show project` (resolved)
- **namedInputs** control cache invalidation: `default` (all files), `production` (excludes lint config), `sharedGlobals` (workspace-wide)
- `!` prefix in inputs = exclude; `^` prefix = upstream dependencies
- **targetDefaults** apply to every project using that executor — `cache`, `dependsOn`, `inputs`
- Build uses `production` inputs, test uses `default` inputs (different cache granularity)
- **Plugins auto-infer targets** from config files — Playwright sees `playwright.config.ts`, ESLint sees `eslint.config.mjs`
- Configuration merge: `options` (base) + `configurations.<name>` (overrides) = final config
- `serve` delegates to `build` via `buildTarget: "shell:build:development"` — no config duplication
- `outputs` tells NX where artifacts go for cache restoration
- **tsconfig.base.json `paths`** enables clean cross-project imports — auto-populated by generators
- tsconfig inheritance: `tsconfig.base.json` → `tsconfig.json` → `tsconfig.app.json` / `tsconfig.spec.json`
- `defaultBase` in nx.json = git branch for `nx affected` comparisons

### Lesson 1.5
- NX dependency graph built from: TypeScript imports, `dependsOn` config, `implicitDependencies`
- `nx graph` visualizes all project relationships; `nx graph --affected` shows only affected subgraph
- **`affected` vs `run-many`**: affected only runs tasks on projects impacted by changes (vs all projects)
- `affected` compares current branch to `defaultBase` (main), maps changed files → projects → downstream deps
- `nx show projects --affected` lists affected project names
- Parallel execution is automatic; control with `--parallel=N`
- `nx reset` fixes SQLite cache corruption (common after version migrations)
- At scale: affected + caching can reduce CI from 30min to < 3min

## Questions & Answers

### Lesson 1.2
**Q: Is nesting the NX workspace inside a subdirectory the recommended industry standard?**
A: No. The standard is NX workspace at the **root** of the git repo. Nesting causes friction with NX Console (VS Code extension), CI/CD pipelines, NX CLI (always needing to cd), and NX Cloud. Non-NX files like COURSE_STATE.md can coexist at root without issues. `create-nx-workspace` generates at root by default for this reason.

## Notes for Claude

- Student has 10 years Angular experience - skip basic Angular concepts
- Focus heavily on NX architecture and Microfrontend patterns
- Use Signals throughout (not traditional RxJS where signals work better)
- Tailwind for all styling
- Student implements everything - Claude provides instructions only
- Be concise but thorough on architectural decisions
- Real-world patterns are important (Tech Lead needs to teach team)
- **Create a lesson .md file** in `lessons/` for every lesson (theory, hands-on steps, key files, takeaways)
